KalaKriti AI: An AI-Powered E-commerce Platform for Local Artisans
üåü Vision
Indian artisans and craftsmen possess incredible traditional skills but often struggle to connect with modern digital audiences. KalaKriti AI is a prototype e-commerce platform designed to bridge this gap. It leverages the power of Google's Generative AI to provide local artisans with intelligent tools to market their craft, tell their unique stories, and automate their digital workflow, ultimately expanding their reach and preserving valuable cultural heritage.

This project was developed as a creative solution to empower artisans in the digital marketplace.

‚ú® Core Features
This platform is a multi-page Streamlit application that serves both customers and artisans.

üõçÔ∏è Public E-commerce Marketplace: A beautiful, searchable storefront where customers can discover and view products from all registered artisans.

üë§ Secure Artisan Dashboard: A password-protected area where artisans can register, log in, and manage their profile.

‚úçÔ∏è AI-Powered Product Listing: Artisans provide basic product details, and the AI (powered by Google Gemini) generates multiple compelling, ready-to-use description suggestions (story-driven, bullet points, social media captions). The AI always uses the artisan's personal story as the core context for authentic results.

ü§ñ Automated Assistant Bot: A context-aware chatbot that artisans can use to see how an AI would answer customer questions. The bot uses the artisan's story and product details as its only source of truth, ensuring accurate and helpful responses.

üóìÔ∏è AI Post Planner: A social media strategist tool that generates a complete 3-day content plan based on a specific campaign goal, helping artisans automate their marketing workflow.

üåê Multilingual Support: The entire platform can be translated into Hindi and Gujarati with a single click, powered by the Google Cloud Translate API.
